Stuck Zombies - ducking, floating, or else not stagger-able; the worst kind of course being those which attack you still - will not escape your close combat wrath anymore. They'll die to your second melee blow.

Now also hits Zombies which dont trigger the entity_shoved event! (AKA the unhittables) All you must do is aim at them as you melee!
