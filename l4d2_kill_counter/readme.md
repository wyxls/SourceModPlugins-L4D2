# Description

For both yourself and your team. It is an Accurate measure of count which includes Special Infected. Including Tank & Witch. It displays on your screen in the Hint Section. It also has a Panel that displays a bit more information. Both your Kills & Headshots. Plus your total Kills and your Headshot to Kill Ratio.

Modification:

- Add new convar `sm_killcounter_hint_type` to determine which hint type should use. (0 = off, 1 = Center text, 2 = Hint Text, 3 = Chat Text)
