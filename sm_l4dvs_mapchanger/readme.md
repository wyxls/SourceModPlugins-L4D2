# Description

Auto switch to next official campaign in finales or switch to next map after finale of 3rd party campaigns. Needs to maintain map list manually. (data/sm_l4d*\_mapchanger*.txt)

It is tested by me and works fine so far, But the sourcecode was not public from origin source and has been lost for long time, so it's not possible to edit or fix any problems at all. I'm not recommend this plugin for features above unless you don't care about future updates.

Use [[L4D2] Improved Automatic Campaign Switcher (ACS) ](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=308708)instead
